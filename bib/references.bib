  abstract = "As single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have
              rapidly developed, so have analysis methods. Many methods have
              been tested, developed, and validated using simulated datasets.
              Unfortunately, current simulations are often poorly documented,
              their similarity to real data is not demonstrated, or
              reproducible code is not available. Here, we present the Splatter
              Bioconductor package for simple, reproducible, and
              well-documented simulation of scRNA-seq data. Splatter provides
              an interface to multiple simulation methods including Splat, our
              own simulation, based on a gamma-Poisson distribution. Splat can
              simulate single populations of cells, populations with multiple
              cell types, or differentiation paths.",
