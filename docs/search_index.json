Second paragraph of abstract starts here. Declaration This is to certify that: the thesis comprises only their original work towards the [name of the award] except where indicated in the preface; due acknowledgement has been made in the text to all other material used; and the thesis is fewer than the maximum word limit in length, exclusive of tables, maps, bibliographies and appendices or that the thesis is [number of words] as approved by the Research Higher Degrees Committee.
