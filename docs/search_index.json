Second paragraph of abstract starts here. Declaration This is to certify that: the thesis comprises only their original work towards the [name of the award] except where indicated in the preface; due acknowledgement has been made in the text to all other material used; and the thesis is fewer than the maximum word limit in length, exclusive of tables, maps, bibliographies and appendices or that the thesis is [number of words] as approved by the Research Higher Degrees Committee. Preface This is an example of a thesis setup to use the reed thesis document class (for LaTeX) and the R bookdown package, in general. Acknowledgements This template is based on thesisdown (https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) and makes use of RMarkdown (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and bookdown https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/. The LaTeX template is based on John Papandriopoulosâ€™ University of Melbourne thesis template (https://github.com/jpap/phd-thesis-template). Inspriation also comes from similar projects including beaverdown (https://github.com/zkamvar/beaverdown), aggidown (https://github.com/ryanpeek/aggiedown), huskydown (https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown) and jayhawkdown (https://github.com/wjakethompson/jayhawkdown).
